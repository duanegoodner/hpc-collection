# High Performance Computing Collection

This repository showcases a set of advanced high-performance computing (HPC) projects developed using C++, MPI, and OpenMP, and benchmarked on real-world distributed systems. The projects focus on optimizing memory-bound and compute-intensive workloads through tiling, communication pattern design, parallel synchronization, and hybrid MPI/OpenMP execution.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

| Project Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [`hpc-irregular-mem-access`](./public/hpc-irregular-mem-access) | Explores cache performance in irregular memory access patterns and compiler optimizations. |
| [`hpc-matrix-ops`](./public/hpc-matrix-ops) | Implements tiled matrix transpose and multiplication with OpenMP loop-level parallelism. |
| [`hpc-primes-gs`](./public/hpc-primes-gs) | Benchmarks OpenMP scheduling for prime checking and synchronizes a parallel Gauss-Seidel solver. |
| [`hpc-gas-sim`](./public/hpc-gas-sim) | Simulates 2D molecular dynamics with MPI and AMPI, including ghost particle exchange and load balancing. |
| [`hpc-dist-hist-sort`](./public/hpc-dist-hist-sort) | Performs a distributed histogram sort using MPI one-sided messaging and quantile-based binning. |

Each project directory includes a detailed summary of methods, performance insights, and the HPC concepts demonstrated.
