# Irregular Memory Access and Compiler Optimizations

This project explores the performance implications of memory access patterns and compiler optimizations on modern CPU architectures.

## Overview

The assignment is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Irregular Memory Access
Benchmarks were run on a program that performs pseudorandom accesses to elements of a large array. The goal was to analyze how execution time is affected by array size and CPU cache behavior. Results show a sharp increase in access time when the total array size exceeds the 64KB L1 cache limit, highlighting the impact of cache misses on performance.

### Part 2: Compiler Optimization Effects
Five short C++ programs were compiled and benchmarked using `-O0` (no optimization) and `-O3` (aggressive optimization) flags. Execution times were recorded for each version, demonstrating how optimization can dramatically improve runtime performanceâ€”especially in compute-heavy or memory-bound code.

## Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

- Memory hierarchy and spatial/temporal locality
- Effects of CPU cache on performance
- Benchmarking using SLURM and a Singularity container
- Compiler optimization flags (`-O0` vs. `-O3`)
- Interpreting performance results using timing data

## System & Tools

- Intel Xeon E5-2670 v2 CPUs (Campus Cluster)
- CMake & C++17
- SLURM job scheduler
- Singularity container for controlled benchmarking environment
